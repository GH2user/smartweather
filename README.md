# Smart Weather for Home Assistant
![WeatherFlow Logo](https://github.com/briis/hass-SmartWeather/blob/master/images/weatherflow.png)<br>
This a *custom component* for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). It combines real-time weather readings from a Smart Weather weather station produced by *WeatherFlow* and Forecast data from *Dark Sky*.

It can create several `sensor` entities for each weather reading like Temperature, Precipitation, Rain etc. and it can create two `binary_sensor`, one indicating if it freezes outside and one indicating if it is raining. Finally it can also create a `weather` component, that then combines the real-time readings from the Weather Station and the Forecast data from Dark Sky, in to a standard `weather`component. 

The `smartweather` component uses the [WeatherFlow](https://weatherflow.github.io/SmartWeather/api/swagger/) REST API to retrieve current data for a local WeatherStation, and it uses [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev) to retrieve Forecast data if the `weather` component is activated.

## Installation
1. If you don't already have a `custom_component` directory in your config directory, create it, and then create a directory called `smartweather`under that.
2. Copy all the files from this repository in to the *smartweather* folder. Remember to maintain the directory structure.

## Configuration
Edit your *configuration.yaml* file and add the *smartweather* component to the file:
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
smartweather:
  station_id: <your station id>
```
If you have your own Smart Weather Station, then you know your Station ID. If you don't have one, there are a lot of public stations available, and you can find one near you on [this link](https://smartweather.weatherflow.com/map). If you click on one of the stations on the map, you will see that the URL changes, locate the number right after */map/* - this is the Station ID
